- Lead technical execution of multi quarter projects involving cross functional dependencies.
- Became an expert in Bitcoin low level implementation, Ethereum blockchain and smart contract execution.

### Notable Projects

- Push 2FA
  - I lead this project which enabled second factor authentication for ~500k users via Push notifications.
  - It increased security for our customers and improved their user experience by bringing the average sign-in time from 18 seconds to 8 seconds.

- Add support for ERC20 currencies
  - This project enabled ERC20 currencies support into Coinbase Commerce increasing customer base by 3% per ERC20 currency.
  - I refactored the codebase to enable support for multiple currencies on a single blockchain namely Ethereum.
  - This paved the path to enabling more currencies quickly on the platform thus widening its target customer base and also became a foundational block in the SingleETH project.

- SingleETH
  - This project lowered our customer fees on Ethereum network by 43%.
  - Prior to this, the original design resulted in the customer having to pay unreasonably high fees to withdraw their ETH (and ETH based currency) funds.
  - This project completely revamped address generation and ensured customer's funds can be withdrawn easily with lower fees.
  - This project was also the first instance of a Coinbase team deploying smart contracts on the blockchain.
