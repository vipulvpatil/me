### Highlights

After 4+ years at Coinbase, I decided to take a break and build a few interesting projects. The aim was to pursue something akin to [12 starups 12 months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/). The [original plan]({{<relref "blog/old/the-idea-the-plan-and-the-journey-so-far-f46ffb8db9f5/">}}) and [final situation]({{<relref "blog/old/5-projects-in-5months-more-like-3-projects-in-8-months-452505877f1b/">}}) became blog posts in their own right. The journey allowed me to further enhance my skills as an engineer and highlighted my weakness as a product owner.
