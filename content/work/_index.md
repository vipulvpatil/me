## Current

I am looking for a Product-based engineering role where I can put to use my experience building end-to-end solutions to customer problems

## Background

My journey into software engineering started in the aftermath of the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis). Jobs were hard to come by! But a stroke of luck got me, my start as a [Game Programmer with Animedia Interactive]({{< relref "/work/animedia" >}}). My Game programming continued with my next job with [Kreeda Games]({{< relref "/work/kreeda" >}}). In 2012, I took a step back and re-evaluated my career. Given the limited game development opportunities in India, I switched lanes into iOS app development. Although it was a struggle early on, by the end of 2013, I had landed a job in San Francisco with [Originate]({{< relref "/work/originate" >}}) working as an iPhone developer. The next 4 years, truly allowed me to fluidly work across the full stack of engineering. During this time, I did frontend programming using Javascript and Coffeescript, and backend programming using Python, NodeJS and Golang. In 2018, I conciously decided to go deeper into backend programming and joined [Coinbase]({{< relref "/work/coinbase" >}}). At Coinbase, I largely worked on the [Coinbase Commerce](https://www.coinbase.com/commerce) team doing Ruby on Rails, Golang and Typescript. I left Coinbase in early 2023 as a full fledged Product engineering having built and maintained multiple projects and systems.
