My journey into software engineering started in the aftermath of the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis). Jobs were hard to come by, but a stroke of luck got me my start as a [Game Programmer with Animedia Interactive]({{< relref "/work/animedia" >}}). My Game programming continued with my next job with [Kreeda Games]({{< relref "/work/kreeda" >}}). In 2012, I took a step back and re-evaluated my career. Given the limited game development opportunities in India, I switched lanes into iOS app development. Although it was a struggle early on, by the end of 2013, I had landed a job in San Francisco with [Originate]() working as an iPhone developer.
