I joined Animedia (later rebranded as Axis Entertainment) in September of 2008. I had no knowledge of Flash Game Programming and had never before worked with ActionScript. I picked up the basics on the job and then made my first ever game, [Counter Drift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLmn6uD1G84). Over the next 2 years, not only did I master ActionScript 3.0 but also gained expertise in the art of game development.

Apart from programming, I picked up a few soft skills at Animedia. I had done software projects before but doing so in tandem with other people was new to me. Working with a team of (Game and Visual) designers helped me understand my own limitations and also built up my collaboration muscle. A large part of my current positive energy comes from my experiences at Animedia. I left Animedia in 2010 and moved to [Kreeda Games]({{< relref "/work/kreeda" >}}).
