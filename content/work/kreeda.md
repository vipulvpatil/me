Having joined Kreeda as an experience Flash Game developer, I was able to hit the ground runnning. I built a physics engine for a 2D puzzle game in my first week and continued to improve it during my tenure. A lot of my time at Kreeda was spent building simple engines for various genre of games. Another notable one being, a scroller engine for 2D scrollering games.

Kreeda was my first introduction to leading small development teams. I was the engineering lead for all Flash Games being built at Kreeda. My responsiblity included planning and timely delivery of all projects built by my team.
