# Background
Graduating with a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering** was highly sought during the early 2000s in *Mumbai, India*. Doing so in **2008**, meant that I had to navigate the after effects of a [Global Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis). Somehow I landed a job as a Flash Game Programmer and began my journey into the world of Software. In **2010**, Steve Job's [open letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Flash) nudged me towards expanding my limited skillset. By **2012**, I had become an iOS Game Programmer. Come **2014**, I was as a Fullstack developer well settled in *San Francisco, U.S.A.* After a [disaster-ridden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) **2020**, I moved back to India to continue life as Backend Programmer. That is where I am **now**
