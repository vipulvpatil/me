As mentioned in my previous [post]({{< relref "/blog/old/so-i-am-going-to-start-blogging-again-5fbba818462e" >}}), I started blogging again. Now I need to ensure that I do not stop. That just means I simply need to keep posting regularly. Sounds simple!

Wait a minute, its not that simple. I still need to figure what I am going to post about. I have been thinking about this and there is a lot I want to talk about. But as always, I am thinking who would want to read any of it. If you have met me in person, you would know I am not a man of few words. I love sharing a pointless story that seems to have nothing to do with the ongoing conversation. Tangents are my favorite and and sometimes I don’t seem to need them to switch topics. If that paints me as a bad listener, that is not the case. Let me explain how my mind works.

In my own head, I struggle to keep pace with how fast my thoughts go from one related topic to another. So between the time that someone said something to the time that I respond to that, my thoughts have jumped about four times and I am far away from the original thought. As a result, what I end up saying, seems completely unrelated to what was last said. Previously, it would stop me from saying what I am trying to say but now I just run with it and love watching a mixture of amusement and confusion on everyone’s faces.

Because I am always around amazing folks, I rarely, if ever, run the risk of losing my audience. But this is the internet, no one has time for tangents. I go on a tangent, and the reader has already scrolled to the next story. Wait, what was I talking about! I went on a tangent, didn’t I?

Seems like I still, have you here, so I will try and wrap this up before I lose you. Let’s back up. I was talking about what am I going to post in this blog. Since I can’t help going down tangents, maybe I will explore them. One at a time, or interspersed with other stories. Some stories will be about my life in India, some will talk about my learnings as a programmer, while others will be about me figuring out how to eat a burrito. Spoiler alert: I unwrapped the tortilla and it was a mess.

Yes, that’s it! I will just write anything that seems midlly interesting to me. It will be a free form anthology.

Or maybe it will take shape and there will be themes, or one main theme. I see a tangent, but I will save it for another post. The key thing for now is to not stop.

Yeto,

Vipul
