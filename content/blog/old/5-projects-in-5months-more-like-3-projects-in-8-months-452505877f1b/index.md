Some time mid January 2023, about 8 months ago, I embarked on a new phase of life. The [plan]({{< relref "/blog/old/the-idea-the-plan-and-the-journey-so-far-f46ffb8db9f5" >}}) was to build 5 projects in 5 months with an exact notion of what I wanted to achieve. Even though I did meet some of my targets, I largely missed the mark. So here I am writing down my learnings from this experimental journey.

#### A quick timeline

I have finished my 3rd project and am currently formulating an official launch. It is called Prospect and is already available [here](https://prospect.fit). Prospect, [Joblead.io](https://www.joblead.io/) and [AiRetreat.co](https://airetreat.co/) make it 3 projects completed in 8 months. That averages to about two and a half months per project. However, the actual project time for each was vastly different. The first project [Joblead.io](https://www.joblead.io/) was completed within **3 weeks** and launched at the end of January. [AiRetreat.co](https://airetreat.co/) took about **3 months** and debuted early May. And now I have spent another **4 months** to finish and launch [Prospect](https://www.prospect.fit). Overall, a major deviation from the planned timeline and something to improve upon in the future.

#### The key learnings

There seem to be something new I learnt every week, if not every day so it would be near impossible to mention every little thing in a single blog post. Instead, here are my 3 main takeaways from these past 8 months.

1.  **Take a step back and recalibrate often.** Writing code everyday kept me throughly buried in the minute details of the project I was working on. Sometimes, I would spend weeks working on a feature only to realize a mistake or an incorrect assumption that ruins multiple weeks of hard work. As this kept happening over and over, I started doing retrospectives with myself. These retrospectives were aimed at keeping my day to day work aligned with my long term goals. Is this, really amazing feature worth the extra 2 weeks it will add? Now that some of the original assumption no longer hold true, should I spend a few weeks on refactoring the system as per new findings? Questions like these became a staple of my retrospectives and helped navigate the overall project efficiently. So it has now become a habit for me to periodically ask myself am I still walking in the right direction? When the answer is not a resounding yes, I take a step back and recalibrate my path forward.
2.  **Acknowledging and accepting self doubt is more helpful than fighting or denying it.** I am very fortunate to be surrounded by smart and intelligent people. But with that also comes self doubt. Numerous conversations over the past months, have left me with immense questions. **Am I doing the right thing? Is this project worth building? Is it better to simply quit and find a job?** My default reaction to it was to fight it and simply channel my willpower to suppress it. This helped but my willpower would take a huge hit. Then if self doubt crept up again, I would not have enough willpower left to fight it. Soon I realized, there was a different approach to tackling this. I started accepting the self doubt and started being ready for a future where my ongoing endeavors might fail. **Am I doing the right thing?** _Maybe not, but I will do it till next week and see if I feel differently._ **Is this project worth building?** _Probably not, but let me spend another month on it and release a simple MVP before I stop._ **Is it better to simply quit and find a job?** _Seems like it. Let me set a date in the next month to do so._ These simple solutions would give me a clear plan of action to continue what I was doing, while ensuring my self doubt had been sated by an acceptable future outcome.
3.  **Best way to fight low motivation is a complete downtime.** June and July were my toughest months of this entire 8 month period. I had even written a [post]({{< relref "/blog/old/when-everyday-is-a-wednesday-56f4c688360c" >}}) about my struggles during June. The solutions I mentioned for low motivation did not work well enough. A little break or weekend rest, would rejuvenate me but I would fall into the abyss of low enthusiasm pretty quickly. So i just chugged along, until my wife suggested a short and quick getaway. We went to a nearby town and stayed in a cabin in the woods for a few nights. For the first time in years, I travelled without my laptop or my Nintendo Switch. I did have my phone on me, but beyond [chess](https://chess.com) I am not really hooked to any app on it. So for the first time in a long while, I was somewhat disconnected. We did some nice nature walks, saw a beautiful coffee farm and spent our evenings listening to cicadas. The cicadas were noisy and a little annoying but the overall stay was amazing. And the break fully refreshed me. I was back to my old, super excited self. On our return trip, I could not wait to get back to work.

These three things along with many others have significantly change me. And I am now excited to see where it all leads.

#### A look back

This year so far has been a breath of fresh air. I have gone from being a pure backend engineer to learning significant amounts of frontend engineering as well learning the basics of good visual design. Hopefully all these improvements in myself will reflect in [Prospect](https://www.prospect.fit/) as well as all my future projects. The learnings mentioned above only provide a narrow glimpse into everything I have learnt so far. But I truly believe we never stop learning. So on the path of further self improvement, I will keep trudging along.

As I rollout [Prospect](https://www.prospect.fit/), I will continue to post my findings and my experiences. For now, you can try the [test version](https://www.prospect.fit/candidates?testMode=true) or Prospect or watch the [demo](https://www.prospect.fit/demo).
