{.columnized}

Based out of Bengaluru 🇮🇳, I am an Engineer, with deep expertise in Golang. In my last role with Coinbase, I was a Senior Software Engineer working as a technical lead for the Coinbase Commerce. Although, primarily a Backend engineer, I have extensive experience in end to end product development with a substantial knowledge of React and Node. I enjoy building products that add value to customer’s life in an impactful way. In code, I value readability, simplicity and robustness above everything else.
